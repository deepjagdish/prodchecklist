"Run etcd  / Master as a multi-node (odd numbers, atleast 3) cluster in production","A multi-master setup protects against a wide range of failure modes, from a loss of single master / etcd node. By providing redundancy, a multi-master cluster serves a highly available system for your end users.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/highly-available-master/",checked
Each Master / Etcd  nodes must be deployed on separate hardware machines. ,"The idea behind replication is to run multiple copies of a process so that if one fails, another one can pick up the job.
Each Master / Etcd nodes must be replicated on separate hardware machines running on separate hosts.

RBAC policies are set to the least amount of privileges necessary ,"Pod Security Policies enable fine-grained authorization of pod creation and updates.

Enable Pod Security Policies ,"Pod security policy control is implemented as an optional (but recommended) admission controller. PodSecurityPolicies are enforced by enabling the admission controller, but doing so without authorizing any policies will prevent any pods from being created in the cluster.

Disable privileged containers ,"The Restricted policy is aimed at enforcing current Pod hardening best practices, at the expense of some compatibility. It is targeted at operators and developers of security-critical applications, as well as lower-trust users.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/",checked
Use a read-only filesystem in containers ,"Another security best practice for Kubernetes is to require containers to run with a read-only file system. This is useful because it helps to enforce an immutable infrastructure strategy, since a container whose file system can’t be changed will have to be replaced in order to make changes. This mitigates some of the risks of malicious processes storing or manipulating data inside a container.

https://resources.whitesourcesoftware.com/blog-whitesource/kubernetes-pod-security-policy",checked
Run containers as non-root users ,"The Docker containers by default run with the root privilege and so does the application that runs inside the container. This is another major concern from the security perspective because hackers can gain root access to the Docker host by hacking the application running inside the container.

Enable Network policies to implement secured isolation.,"Prevents unauthorized access, improves security, segregates namespaces.

Vulnerability check for image with kubernetes,"Container images contain OS, runtime, and application (everything but the Linux kernel basically).

Configure the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler  (HPA),"The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler automatically scales the number of Pods in a replication controller, deployment, replica set or stateful set based on observed CPU utilization (or, with custom metrics support, on some other application-provided metrics). Note that Horizontal Pod Autoscaling does not apply to objects that can't be scaled, for example, DaemonSets.

Avoid Configuring vertical pod autoscaler since its in beta.,"Vertical Pod autoscaling frees you from having to think about what values to specify for a container's CPU and memory requests. The autoscaler can recommend values for CPU and memory requests and limits, or it can automatically update the values.

Set Pod CPU request to 1 CPU or below ,"Limits and requests for CPU resources are measured in cpu units. One cpu, in Kubernetes, is equivalent to 1 vCPU/Core for cloud providers and 1 hyperthread on bare-metal Intel processors.

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/",checked
Define CPU and memory limits ,"When you specify the resource request for Containers in a Pod, the scheduler uses this information to decide which node to place the Pod on. When you specify a resource limit for a Container, the kubelet enforces those limits so that the running container is not allowed to use more of that resource than the limit you set.
